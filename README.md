# Cryptogame: Coins2trade 2.0

This is game I developed for a client, since he got desinterested in the project, he's ok with me sharing the source code. One year after I've updated it to a lighter theme and to use the gatsby equivalent in Vue.

### Technologies
- VueJs 2
- Gridsome (Vue counterpart of Gatsby)
- Bootstrap 4
- ChartJs

### To Do list
1. Better savegame methods at Play.vue
2. Update UI for a better UX
3. Add responsiveness 
4. Change title of the site
